When I was training with my brother openings and different variations that are found at the beginning of the game, I discovered the opening, which seems to me to be interesting. However, I was surprised that no one had ever named or analyzed it, especially since my great-grandfather knew it.

> I must admit that I am an amateur chess player, however I train hard for my first tournament with FIDE players. Sometimes I beat players with the ranking over 2000. So I’m on the right way to success.

## Opening

The Czyzewski begins: _1. e4 e5 2. b3_

## Analysis

This position creates many opportunities with equal chances for both players.
_(white win - 33.58%, draw - 33.91%, black win - 32.51%)_

### 1. e4 e5

Advancing the king’s pawn two squares is highly useful because it occupies a center square, attacks the center square _d5_, and allows the development of white’s king’s bishop and queen.

### 2. b3

The white pawn is safe, it’s better move than _b4_, where player simply loses a pawn. In addition, this position allows the development of white’s queen’s bishop, which later it can occupate black pawn on _e5_ (at the same time doing “Polish Trap”).

## Continuations

When black attacks the white pawn on _e4_.

When black tries to block the _d4_ square.

Only few games are known, that use this opening.

## History

A month ago I found a very old notes and notebooks of my great-grandfather, the old box was from 1883. I heard that my grandfather was passionate about chess, but I was surprised that he wrote notes about it.

On one side, I discovered a strange entitled page. It was called “Delayed Queen’s Fianchetto Opening” (org. spozniony laufer przy otwarciu). Which was describing this chess opening, what got me thinking about this strange position.

I will try to translate a notes into English and update this article, and create separate paper devoted entirely to this opening.

## Usefulness

In practice, hypermodernism has not replaced the classical theory of Steinitz and Tarrasch. Instead, modern chess textbooks describe hypermodernism as an addition, or extension, to classical theory.

<u>So certainly Czyzewski is not and it will not be a popular opening in future.</u>

Although I played hundreds of correspondence games with it, and I think it’s a pretty good opening.
