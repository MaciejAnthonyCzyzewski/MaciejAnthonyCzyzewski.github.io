<h3>Publications</h3>

<p>Science development is important nowadays, therefore I am writing papers on subjects such as mathematics, computer science and cryptography.</p>

      December 24, 2015 [PRIVATE]
      <p>This document describes forgotten <u>chess variation</u>, it also provides examples, comments and analysis. The idea came as a result of finding old notes from 1883 of my great-grandfather, who has been analyzing two different positions with curious concept - “Delayed Fianchetto Opening”. Practice has shown that it is a <i>great position for playing Blitz and Bullets</i> games.</p>

      May 15, 2016 [IACR]
      <p>In this paper we describe a theoretical model of <u>chaos machine</u>, which combines the benefits of hash function and pseudo-random function, forming flexible <i>one-way</i>&nbsp;<u>push-pull interface</u>. It presents the idea to create a universal tool (design pattern) with modular design and customizable parameters, that can be applied where&nbsp;<i>randomness</i> and <i>sensitiveness</i> is needed (random oracle), and where&nbsp;appropriate construction determines case of application and selection of parameters provides preferred properties and security level. Machine can be used to implement many cryptographic primitives, including cryptographic hashes, message authentication codes and pseudo-random number generators.</p>
