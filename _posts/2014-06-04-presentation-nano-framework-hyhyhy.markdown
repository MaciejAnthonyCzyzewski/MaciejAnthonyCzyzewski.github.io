## Introduction

It's a tool for easily creating pure and simple HTML5 presentations or websites.

Comes with a broad range of features including nested slides, markdown contents and a JavaScript API. It combines everything into a unified whole that you can use.

I hope someone does it profit or want to [contribute][hyhyhy-gh].

## Idea

I wanted to create something simpler, nicer and more efficient. And also thing that works on all devices and browsers in every format.

The goal was to make package that will speed up work on own speech.
