The __year 2038 problem__ is an issue for computing and data storage situations in which time values are stored or calculated as a _signed 32-bit_ integer.

All the smart kids know that this number is interpreted as the number of seconds since _00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970_ (“the epoch”).

## Mathematics

<p class="ta"><span class="equation" data-expr="2147483648 = 2^{31}"></span> is a perfect 31st power.</p>

Timestamp will be out of _signed 32-bit_ range...

## Solution

* Change _signed 32-bit_ to _signed 64-bit_
* Start counting from the date of _03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038_

## Analogy
