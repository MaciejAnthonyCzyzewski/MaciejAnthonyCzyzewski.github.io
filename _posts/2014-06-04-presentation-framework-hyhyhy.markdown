> _A Ruby library for creating and outputting professional, business-looking (HTML5) presentations that can be viewed inside the browser!_

## Introduction

[__hyhyhy__][hyhyhy-gh] is used from the _Ruby CLI_ and relies on a series of steps that developers (and even regular users) can go through to build a simple presentation.

Once these steps completed, an HTML5 file is generated which can be accessed, viewed, and hosted online.

## Features

All hyhyhy presentations come with support for a wide range of features, like __Markdown text formatting__, __page transitions__, __sequential transitions__ for objects on the page, __syntax highlighting__, and __mathematical functions__.

Thereâ€™s also support for __keyboard shortcuts__, showing the position inside the overall __presentation timeline__, __hashed URLs__ for easy deep-linking, __automatic rebuilds__ on content changes, __responsive layouts__, and __touch gestures__ on mobile devices.

All presentations are very well supported across browsers and the library also includes lots of documentation.

## Contributing

The goal was to make package that will speed up work on own presentation. I hope someone does it profit or want to [contribute][hyhyhy-gh].
